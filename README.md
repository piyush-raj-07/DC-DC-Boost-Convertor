# DC-DC-Boost-Convertor

## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a non-isolated DC-DC boost converter. The converter steps up an input voltage of 7.5 V to 12.5 V using a switching frequency of 10 kHz. Both Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) and Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) operations are demonstrated through waveform analysis of the switch current and diode voltage.

## ⚙️ Specifications
- Input Voltage (Vg): 7.5 V

- Output Voltage (Vo): 12.5 V

- Switching Frequency: 10 kHz

- Output Current: 1 A

- Inductance (L): 1 mH

- Inductor Resistance (RL): 0.3 Ω

- Diode Forward Drop (Vf): 1.1 V
